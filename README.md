# ghpages-react-es6-bs4-webpack

Boilerplate for a GitHub Pages site utilising React, Bootstrap 4, Babel and Webpack

#### Quick Setup (if you haven't already):

1.  [Fork this repository](https://github.com/kvsm/ghpages-react-es6-bs4-webpack).
2.  You'll probably want to rename your fork to whatever you want to name your project (in the repository's settings page on GitHub).
3.  Clone your fork to your local machine.
4.  Run `npm install`. This will install required dependencies.
5.  Run `npm run build`. This will compile your assests and generate a bundle in the `docs/assets` directory.
6.  Commit the new bundle to git and push to GitHub.
7.  That's it! Your project is now live at:  
    `http://your-github-username.github.io/your-project-name`
